# Real-Time Collaborative Coding Platform

🌐 **Live demo:** https://live-code-together.onrender.com/ 
<sub>Optimized for Chrome, Edge, and Safari[1]</sub>

## 🚀 Overview

This platform enables multiple users to **write, run, and debug code together in real time**. It is designed to make collaborative programming, teaching, and code review easy and productive, bringing people together through an interactive and flexible coding environment.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Lobby System:**  
  Effortlessly create a new coding room to host a session or join an existing one. Each lobby acts as a collaborative space where users can work together in real-time on coding problems or projects.

- ✅ **Live Code Collaboration:**  
  All participants—for hosts and joiners alike—see code edits, inputs, and outputs the moment they happen. Code changes by anyone are synchronized and displayed to everyone, making real-time teamwork smooth and engaging.

- ✅ **Multi-Language Support:**  
  Easily switch between popular programming languages such as Python, C, C++, Java, and more. The platform lets groups experiment and practice in their language of choice without any extra setup.

- ✅ **AI Assistant:**  
  An integrated AI assistant offers instant suggestions, code corrections, bug fixes, and explanations as you write code. This helps users learn faster and overcome coding obstacles together.

- ✅ **Secure Login:**  
  Users sign in quickly and securely via Google or GitHub. This ensures that only authorized members join sessions, keeping your collaborative environment safe.

- ✅ **Integrated Chat:**  
  Each coding session features built-in chat. Communicate in real-time with group members, discuss code snippets, ask questions, and share ideas—all within the same collaborative workspace.

- ✅ **Live Host Updates:**  
  Any code modifications made by the session host are shared immediately and without delay to all participants. Whether it's initializing a function, running an example, or guiding the class, everyone stays in sync with the host’s current code.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 👨‍🏫 **Live Coding Classes:**  
  Instructors can invite students into a shared workspace to teach coding concepts live. Everyone can follow the lesson, interact with the host’s code, and participate in class exercises.

- 👥 **Group Practice:**  
  Teams or friends can code together in one room—solving problems, building projects, or preparing for contests. Since everyone's actions are visible, collaborative problem-solving becomes productive and interactive.

- 💬 **Collaborative Debugging:**  
  Quickly find and fix bugs as a group. Share your screen, highlight problems, type solutions collaboratively, and get instant feedback from teammates without context-switching.

- 🧑‍💻 **Exploring Ideas:**  
  Experiment and brainstorm new algorithms or project prototypes together. With multi-language support and a synchronized coding view, trying out fresh concepts in a group is easy and inspiring.
